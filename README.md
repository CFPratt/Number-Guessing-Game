Hey if you're looking in this file this is a Number Guessing Game.

The python code generates a random integer and then the User has to guess it, getting hints on higher and lower numbers.

If you're new to python and find this I hope it helps, if you're not new to python this is probably really easy for you but... this is day one of me learning :D
